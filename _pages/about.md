**About Me**

Hello! I’m Jorge, a community psychologist who’s always been fascinated by technology. I chose psychology to gain a human-focused perspective on social issues, and along the way, I realized how powerful data-driven research can be for creating real impact. Now, I’m excited to stand at the intersection of tech and the social sciences—combining tools like NLP and Python with insights from psychology, sociology, and policy to tackle challenges that matter.

My work aims to drive equitable outcomes in areas like mental health, education, and community development. In my downtime, you’ll find me behind a drum set, exploring new music genres and collaborating with fellow musicians. Ultimately, I’m all about leveraging new ideas and tools for projects that spark meaningful change—because when technology and empathy meet, we can build a brighter, more inclusive future.

**Featured Projects**

1. NLP Analysis of Chilean Politicians’ Statements

A data pipeline that collects and processes statements from Chilean politicians on recently passed laws, applying sentiment analysis and topic modeling to uncover key themes in public discourse. Built with Python and NLP libraries, this project highlights how data can drive transparency and accountability in governance.
2. Work in Progress

I’m currently experimenting with new tools and methodologies for my next project—stay tuned for more details! My goal is to continue blending social science insights with data science techniques to foster positive social impact.
